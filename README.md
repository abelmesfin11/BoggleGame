# Taken rules from Boggle's wikipedia article. To run, use "python3 bogglegame.py".

Each player searches for words that fit the following criteria:

Words must be at least three letters in length.
Each letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.
No individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.
No capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.
We play on a 4x4 grid of randomized letters. Click on letters one at a time to build a word. When you are "done" building the word, click again on the last letter. This submits the word. If the word is recognized as a successful word, it will be kept on the right. If the submitted word is not a recognized word (i.e. not a word at all), nothing will happen.

The "Reset" button will randomize the words and clear any submitted words before it.
